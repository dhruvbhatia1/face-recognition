# Face Recognition Project 

Developed a facial recognition program using Python, NumPy, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm, and OpenCV library for image processing. 
Program stores facial data in a NumPy file and achieves 90% accuracy in recognizing stored facial data. 
This project required expertise in image processing, machine learning, and programming.
